    "\n",
    "### Components of Time Series\n",
    "The various reasons or the forces which affect the values of an observation in a time series are the components of a time series. The four categories of the components of time series:\n",
    "- Trend: Trend is defined as long term increase or decrease in the data. It can be linear or non-linear\n",
    "- Seasonality: It is characteristics of time series in which data experiences regular and predictable changes after a fixed period.\n",
    "- Cyclic: A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period.\n",
    "- Irregularity/Residuals: After removing all above-mentioned components from time series, the remaining part is called irregular component.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/timeseries-components.PNG) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Mean Absolute Error (MAE)__: It is mean of mod(actual - predicted value). This metric is easy to interpret as it has the same unit of measurement as the initial series. It can range from [0, +inf)\n",
    "- __Mean Squared Error(MSE)__: This is mean of (actual-predicted)^2. The squared error gives higher penalty to large deviations. This ranges from [0,+inf)\n",
    "- __Root mean squared error (RMSE)__: This is standard deviation of the residuals. Range: [0, +inf)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of various metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE has the benefit of penalizing large errors more so can be more appropriate in some cases, for example, if being off by 10 is more than twice as bad as being off by 5. But if being off by 10 is just twice as bad as being off by 5, then MAE is more appropriate.\n",
    "- From an interpretation standpoint, MAE is clearly the winner. RMSE does not describe average error alone and has other implications that are more difficult to tease out and understand.\n",
    "- On the other hand, one distinct advantage of RMSE over MAE is that RMSE avoids the use of taking the absolute value, which is undesirable in many mathematical calculations\n",
